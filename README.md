# Vaadin CDI

This is the official CDI integration for [Vaadin Flow](https://github.com/vaadin/flow).

This branch is compatible with upcoming Vaadin platform versions. See other branches for other Vaadin versions:

* 16.0 for Vaadin 25.0
* 15.2 for Vaadin 24.8
* 15.1 for Vaadin 24.4
* 15.0 for Vaadin 24
* 14.1 for Vaadin 23.3
* 13.1 for Vaadin 22.1
* 11.3 for Vaadin 14.10
* 10.0 for Vaadin 10
* 3.0 for Vaadin 8.2+
* 2.0 for Vaadin Framework 8.0...8.1 versions
* 1.0 for Vaadin Framework 7 versions

## Using with Vaadin

To use CDI with Vaadin, you need to add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupdId>com.vaadin</groupId>
  <artifactId>vaadin-cdi</artifactId>
  <version>15.2.0</version> <!-- Or the LATEST version -->
</dependency>
```

Since the current release version is a prerelease, you need to also include the prerelease Maven repository:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>Vaadin prereleases</id>
    <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-prereleases</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

## Getting started

**NOTE: This is still WIP.** The easiest way for starting a project is to go to [vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) and select the _Project Base with CDI_ to get an empty project with everything setup ready for you.

**NOTE: This is still WIP.** There is a tutorial also available in https://github.com/vaadin/flow-cdi-tutorial that helps you get started with Vaadin 10 and CDI.

## Building the project

Execute `mvn clean install -DskipTests` in the root directory to build vaadin-cdi.

## Run integration tests

Execute `mvn -pl vaadin-cdi-itest -Ptomee verify` in the root directory to run integration tests.

Test can be executed against the following containers, activating the specific profile:

* Wildfly Jakarta EE 10: `-Pwidfly`
* OpenLiberty Jakarta EE 10: `-Pliberty`
* Payara Jakarta EE 10: `-Ppayara`
* TomEE Jakarta EE 10: `-Ptomee`
