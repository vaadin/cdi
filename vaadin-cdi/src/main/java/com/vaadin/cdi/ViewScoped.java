/**
 * The lifecycle of a ViewScoped component starts when the view is navigated to
 * and ends when navigating to a different view or when the UI is closed.
 * <p>
 * Injection with this annotation will create a direct reference to the object
 * rather than a proxy.
 * <p>
 * There are some limitations when not using proxies. Interceptors and
 * decorators will not work. Circular referencing (that is, injecting A to B and
 * B to A) will not work unless there is at least one proxy in between.
 * <p>
 * The sister annotation to this is the {@link NormalViewScoped}. Both
 * annotations reference the same underlying scope, so it is possible to get
 * both a proxy and a direct reference to the same object by using different
 * annotations.
