/**
 * This is a {@code @Stereotype} to let the container scan and manage
 * the instances of the annotated types.
 * <p>
 * Annotating the beans with this annotation is necessary when the
 * {@code bean-discovery-mode="annotated"} is set in the beans.xml
 * file (implicit bean archive), and in this case CDI can only manage
 * and inject beans annotated with a "scope" type.
 * <p>
 * Although, this can be applied to any type of beans such as service
 * objects, it is originally designed to be used on Vaadin components
 * or views that may or may not already bean annotated by any other
 * pseudo-scope annotations e.g. {@code @RouteScoped} or {@code @UIScoped}.
 * See https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.2/cdi-spec.html#normal_scope
 * for more information about scopes and pseudo-scopes.
 * <p>
 * If the explicit bean archive strategy is in use (via an empty
 * beans.xml or the one containing bean-discovery-mode="all"), CDI can
 * manage and inject any bean, except those annotated with @Vetoed.
